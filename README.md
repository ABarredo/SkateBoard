Smart SkateBoard proyect

In this proyect I will be trying to develop a bunch of sensors to track the movement of a skateboard and its riders feet.
  - As a first try to this aim, I have used a Altimu 10v4 (IMU), Arduino micro and a Bluetooth SPP board to get the movement data from the skate. I bought a skateboard model (.obj) and I coded a small script on MaxScript to convert the data into an animation in Autodesk 3dsMax.
